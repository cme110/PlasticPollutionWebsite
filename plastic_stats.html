<p>More than 8.3 billion tons of plastic have been produced since the start of the 1950s when they started mass producing 
plastic. Unfortunately, of the total amount of plastic that has been produced, only 9% has been recycled, 12% has been burnt and 
79% has been thrown into landfills or into the environment and ocean. It is estimated that there are more than 5 trillion individual pieces 
of plastic in the ocean, with an additional 8 million tons more added each year.
