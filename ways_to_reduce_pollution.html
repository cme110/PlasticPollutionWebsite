<p>There are lots of ways to reduce plastic pollution in the ocean. The easiest way is to avoid using single-use plastics like plastic bags and plastic cups and look for alternatives
like reusable bags and cups to use instead. Another way is to stop buying bottled water in plastic bottles and instead carry a reusable bottle that can be refilled at a nearby tap.
If you want to buy something that is in plastic wrap and/or containers like fruit and vegetables, meat, butter or toilet paper, consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_purchasing">
buying in bulk</a> and getting the bigger containers instead of buying lots of the little containers which create more waste than one big container. If you want to take more action on stopping 
plastic pollution, you might think about supporting a ban for some plastic items, like plastic bottles, or if you feel that companies are not being wise about their use of plastic in their products, 
consider letting them know by writing a letter to them or instead, give your money to more sustainable companies.
