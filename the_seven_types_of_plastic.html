<p>The different types of plastic are sorted into 7 groups. The first group contains plastics that are used to make things like plastic bottles. The second group contains plastics 
that are used to make things like plastic milk bottles and some bottle caps. The third group contains plastics that are used to make things like food trays. The fourth group contains
plastics that are used to make things like plastic bags and cling film. The fifth group contains plastics that are used to make things like butter or margarine tubs. The sixth group
contains plastics that are used to make things like disposable cups and parcel packaging. The seventh group contains plastics that are used to make things like CD or DVD cases and 
electrical wiring. Depending on where in the world you live, different groups of plastic can be recycled while others cannot. Normally Groups 1 and 2 can be recycled while Groups
3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 can't. However, check your local area to see which ones can and can't be recycled.
