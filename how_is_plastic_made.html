<p>All plastic is made out of oil or petrol. When scientists heat these chemicals up, they break down into lots of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule">
molecules</a>. These molecules are rearranged to make molecule chains and these chains can be joined together to make plastic. Different combinations of 
molecules make different types of plastic. The plastic is then heated to make it soft and is then poured into a special mould. The plastic hardens in the mould 
as it cools down. This method can be used to make all sorts of plastic from plastic bottles, plastic cups, plastic packaging and plastic straws.
