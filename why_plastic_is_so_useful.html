<p>When plastic was invented, it changed the world forever as it has lots of uses. First of all, it is a really flexible material because it can be made into any 
shape imaginable using a special mould. This can be used to make different packaging for food products and this keeps the food fresh for longer. Second of all, plastic is a really 
strong material. Sporting equipment like bike helmets and mouth guards stop injuries to the head and the jaw and they are made using strong plastic. Third of all, it is also
a really lightweight material. Car companies use plastic to make their cars lighter and to make life-saving car parts like seatbelts and airbags. Finally, plastic is used 
to make electronic devices like TVs and computers because of all three of these useful reasons.
